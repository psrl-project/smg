//! Engine-neutral multimodal pixel RDMA (NIXL) transport for the SMG gateway.
//!
//! The gateway stages each preprocessed image's serialized pixel buffer into a
//! pre-registered host-DRAM arena and hands the worker a small wire descriptor;
//! the worker PULLs the pixels with a one-sided RDMA READ instead of receiving
//! them inline in the gRPC frame. This crate owns only the NIXL *mechanics* and
//! the wire format — **all policy stays in the gateway**: it never reads env vars
//! or router globals; the gateway decides whether RDMA is on, builds a
//! [`RdmaConfig`], and only then constructs a [`RdmaExporter`].
//!
//! The default build compiles a no-op [`RdmaExporter`] (the `nixl` feature off),
//! so ordinary gateway builds need no NIXL headers / clang / bindgen or libnixl.
//! Enable `nixl` to compile the real one-sided-READ implementation.
